=head1 NAME

SNA::Network::Generator::MCMC - Generate random networks by a series of edge swaps according to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo principle


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SNA::Network;

    my $net = SNA::Network->new_from_pajek_net($filename);
    $net->shuffle;
    ...
    for (1.100) {
    	say $net->shuffle->identify_weakly_connected_components;
    }


=head1 METHODS

The following methods are added to L<SNA::Network>.


=head2 shuffle

Generates a random networks by a series of edge swaps on an existing network according to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo principle. This means that the initial network will be changed and have a totally new, random edge structure.

This method will exactly preserve all in- and outdegrees, and is guaranteed to sample uniformly at random from all possible simple graph configurations.

You may optionally pass the number of steps to perform. By default, the currently best known number is used, namely the number of edges in the network multiplied by its logarithm.

Returns the network reference again, in order to enable method chaining.

	}
	
	return $self;
}

	my ($self) = @_;

	my $index_one = int rand int $self->edges;
	my $index_two = int rand int $self->edges;

	my $edge_one = $self->{edges}->[$index_one];
	my $edge_two = $self->{edges}->[$index_two];
	
	if ( uniq($edge_one->source, $edge_one->target, $edge_two->source, $edge_two->target) == 4 ) {
		# swap target nodes
		my $edge_one_target = $edge_one->target;
		$edge_one->{target} = $edge_two->target;
		$edge_two->{target} = $edge_one_target;
	}
}
